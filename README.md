# CONNORS NUMBERS GAME

RULES: There are two players. One person (or in this case, the computer) thinks of any three-digit number. The other player's objective is to guess what number the computer is thinking of.

- After each three-digit guess, the computer reveals two hints: 
(1) Number of places: how many places the player guessed correctly
(2) Number of digits: how digits the player guessed correctly
